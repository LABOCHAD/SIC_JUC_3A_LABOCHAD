 * Collects all entered prices and overloads them to the Arraylist.
 * Uses a scanner for user input, that's closed finally.
 * Numeric inputs to scanner must be followed by a nextLine()
 * in order to get red of needless break line,
 * those are unfortunately created by them.
 * Outputs count of prices to test the method.
 * Lets user decide which price he wants to compare for exceedances.
 * Outputs count of them and finally total of all prices is shown.
