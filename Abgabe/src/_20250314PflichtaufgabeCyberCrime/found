INFO
"Sophia" -> Sophia Reynard (The Wife) - considered Mark as paranoid. - sus
"David" -> Fingerprints on glass and logged in at time of death. - sus
"Ghost" -> Axel "Ghost" Nakamura (The Hacker) - was responsible for penetration tests - lying?
"Elizabeth" -> Bookworm. Hat USB drive in per purse (Maybe she wanted to warn him?) - lying?

I think Sophia is the loved one selling secrets and David was an accomplice.
Both fingerprints on the glass. (David, Sophia)
David seems to have stolen data from the system as Ghost stated (if he didn't lie)
Even if Axel (Ghost) lied, he left no traces or redirected them
Liz seems like she wanted to warn him, but why didn't she mention the pen drive message?

Typed in David. Was correct. I was tending between him and Sophia.
Maybe her fingerprints were just on the glass, cause she lives there and did the dishes before.
Maybe David secretly placed the drive in Elisabeth's purse to lay a false trail and make Sophia being suspected.

Now I solved the crime, I can finally observe the file. :D
